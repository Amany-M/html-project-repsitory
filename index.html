  <h1 style="margin-top:100px;" >Programming languages</h1>
  <p>A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation 
  or computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program.
  While executing the program, raw data is processed into a desired output format.
  These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high level languages.
  High level languages are nearly human languages which are more complex then the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language.
  So after knowing the basics, we are ready to create a very simple and basic program. 
  Like we have different languages to communicate with each other, likewise, we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc to communicate with the computers. 
  The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high-level language which is almost similar to human language.
   </p>
   
   
  <p style="text-indent: 0px;">We can use these programming languages to develop many software applications in different fields to facilitate our life by automating any process
     for example not limited to
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Banking field e.g core banking systems and online banking apps</li>
	  <li>Business management e.g ERP and BPM solutions</li>
	  <li>Educational field e.g Online cources websites</li>	
	  <li>Medical field e.g medical research software and medical appointment scheduling</li>	 
	  <li>Socail media e.g facebook, whatsapp, gmail, youtube</li>	  
	  <li>Gaming</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 0px;"> 
	 We use all these application on a daily basis it makes our life easier and organized with less effort so, let us talk a briefly about some of these programming languages 
	</p>
  
  <ul>
<li><a href="Java.html">Java</a></li>
  <li><a href="Csharp.html">C#</a></li>	
  <li><a href="PHP.html">PHP</a></li>
  <li><a href="paython.html">Paython</a></li>
  <li><a href="Java script.html">Javascript</a></li>
</ul>
  
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;"> 
	 So software engineering corporation seeking to provide a robust efficient software apps to satisfy its customers with top quality of productions.
	</p>
  
   <p style="text-indent: 0px;"> 
	 According to this importance of programming and as we see it surrounds us, it is mandatory to learn multiple programming languages even if we are not a specialized in the field to be up to date with the technology revelution.
